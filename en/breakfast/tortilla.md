# Spanish Tortilla #

## Ingredients ##
```
- 1 ¼ pounds potatoes, 3 or 4 medium
- 1 medium onion
- 1 cup olive oil
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper
- 6 extra-large or jumbo eggs
```

### Directions ###
1. Peel and thinly slice potatoes and onions; it's easiest if you use a mandoline. Meanwhile, heat oil in an 8- or 10-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat. 
2. After 3 or 4 minutes, drop in a potato slice. 
3. When tiny bubbles appear around its edges, add potatoes, onions, a good pinch of salt and a liberal sprinkling of pepper. 
4. Gently turn mixture in oil with a wooden spoon, and adjust heat so oil bubbles lazily.
5. Cook, turning potatoes gently every few minutes, until they are tender when pierced with a small knife. Adjust the heat so they do not brown. If potatoes begin to break, they are overdone; stop cooking immediately. As potatoes cook, beat eggs with some salt and pepper in a large bowl.
6.  Drain potatoes in a colander, reserving oil. Wipe out skillet, and heat over a medium flame for a minute. 
7. Add 2 tablespoons oil. Gently mix warm potatoes with eggs, and add to skillet. 
8. As soon as edges firm up, after a minute or so, reduce heat to medium-low. Cook 5 minutes.
9. Insert a rubber spatula all around edges of tortilla to make sure it will slide from pan. The top will still be runny. 
10. Carefully slide out onto a plate. Cover with another plate, and holding plates tightly, invert them. i
11. Add another tablespoon oil to skillet, and use the spatula to coax tortilla back in. 
12. Cook 5 minutes, then slide from skillet onto a clean plate. Serve warm (not hot), or at room temperature. Do not refrigerate.

#### Notes ####
- When pouring the egg + potato mixture, make sure to pour a layer of the egg part first so a solid bottom is formed before pouring the rest
- Ingredient quantity completely depends on the pan you’re using, you want it coming up maybe 2/3 of the height of the pan when it’s all poured
- Sautee some spinach and add it to the egg, potato, onion mixture for a healthy addition
- Really don’t skip on the salt and pepper
