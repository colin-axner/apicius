# Cheese and Potato Pie #

## Ingredients ##

```
450g/ 1 lb/ 2 1/2 cups potatoes, peeled and sliced
1 clove of garlic, crushed
1 1/4 cups double (heavy) cream
2 tbsp thyme leaves
1 cup Gruyère cheese, grated
1 egg, beaten [optional]
salt and pepper
```

## Steps ##
1. Make double crust pie dough, or use 2 cups puff pastry.
2. Preheat oven to 400 F.
3. Par-boil potatoes in salted water for 12 minutes, drain well.
4. Toss potatoes with garlic, cream, thyme and Gruyère. Season well with salt and pepper.
5. Leave to cool to room temperature.
6. Roll out pie dough and use it to line the pie dish. 
7. Pack the potatoes in tightly and pour any cream left in the bowl over it.  
8. Roll out the rest of the dough and place over the pie, cutting out a hole in the center. 
9. [optional] Brush the top with beaten egg for aesthetics.
10. Bake for 45 minutes. 


**Notes:**
After pulling the pie out of the oven, the center won't solidify until about 10 minutes after the first slice is taken out.
Alternatively you could let the pie cool in the refrigerator over night and warm in oven on the following day.
