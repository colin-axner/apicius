# Pastry for Single-Crust Pie #

## Ingredients ##
```
1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
salt
1/3 cup butter
cold water
```

## Steps ##
1. Mix flour and add ~1/4 tsp salt (or as desired). Do not add salt if using salted butter.
2. Mix in butter into flour mixture until butter is in small pieces. 
3. For the following step, I use one hand to pour water and the other hand to constantly mix flour; Slowly add water attempting to distribute evenly over mixture. 
4. Continue adding water in slowly until you are able to form the dough into a ball. Be careful to not add too much water. Continue until dough is pliable. 
5. Let the dough cool in the fridge for 30 minutes [can use freezer for 5-10 minutes if you are in a rush, but be careful].
6. Using a rolling pin, roll dough out on a floured surface. Continue to add flour to surface and rolling pin as you work the dough. Roll into circle that is slightly wider than the base of the pie dish.
7. If your dough needs to be prebaked, bake at 450 F for 10-12 minutes; This is unnecessary for pies baking for > 40 minutes, such as the potato and cheese pie. 

**Notes:**
If your dough is too crumbly to roll out, try adding water and flour to make it more pliable. It is possible the dough cannot be recovered, in this case you need to start over. 
If your dough is too damp, add flour.
