# Nectarine Amaretto Cake #

## Ingredients ##
```
3 large eggs, separated
3/4 cups superfine sugar
grated rind and juice of 1 lemon
1/3 cup semolina
1/3 cup ground almonds
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
2 nectarines or peaches, halved and pitted
4 tbsp Apricot Glaze

Syrup:
6 tbsp sugar
6 tbsp water
2 tbsp Amaretto liquer
```

### Steps ###
1. Preheat the oven to 350 F. Grease an 8" round cake pan with a removable bottom. Whisk the egg yolks, sugar, lemon rind and juice in a bowl until thick, pale and creamy.
2. Fold in the semolina, almonds and flour until smooth.
3. Whisk the egg whites in a clean bowl until fairly stiff. Using a metal spoon, stir a generous spoonful of the whites into the semolina mixture to lighten it, then fold in the remaining egg whites. Spoon the mixture into the prepared cake pan.
4. Bake for 30-35 minutes, until the center of the cake springs back when lightly pressed. Remove the cake from the oven, and carefully loosen around the edge with a metal spatula. Prick the top of the cake with a skewer, and let cool slightly in the span.
5. Meanwhile, make the syrup. Heat the sugar and water in a small pan, stirring until dissolved, then boil without stirring for 2 minutes. Add the Amaretti liqeur, and drizzle slowly over the cake.
6. Remove the cake from the pan, and transfer it to a serving plate. Slice the nectarines or peaches, arrange them over the top, and brush with the warm Apricot Glaze.
