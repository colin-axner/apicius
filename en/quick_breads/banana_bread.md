### Notes ###
This recipe is very old, passed down through a family tree and kindly provided for this repository.
You don't have to line the pan with anything - but parchment paper is preferred over wax paper.
It usually takes 1 hour and 15 minutes at 300 F. 
Cover the bread with foil at 1 hour. The top will get too done otherwise.
